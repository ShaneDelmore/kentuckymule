/** A class defining symbols and types of standard definitions
 *
 *  Note: There's a much nicer design possible once we have implicit functions.
 *  The idea is explored to some degree in branch wip-definitions (#929): Instead of a type
 *  and a separate symbol definition, we produce in one line an implicit function from
 *  Context to Symbol, and possibly also the corresponding type. This cuts down on all
 *  the duplication encountered here.
 *
 *  wip-definitions tries to do the same with an implicit conversion from a SymbolPerRun
 *  type to a symbol type. The problem with that is universal equality. Comparisons will
 *  not trigger the conversion and will therefore likely return false results.
 *
 *  So the branch is put on hold, until we have implicit functions, which will always
 *  automatically be dereferenced.
