# Kentucky Mule

Kentucky Mule is an exploration of an alternative architecture for compiler design (specifically typechecker) with focus on speed.


Kentucky Mule's origins are described in my blog post [Can Scala have a highly parallel typechecker?] (https://medium.com/@gkossakowski/can-scala-have-a-highly-parallel-typechecker-95cd7c146d20)

Since the time I wrote the blog post, I expanded my focus to a two fold question:

> Can Scala have a highly parallel and high performance question, or does
> Scala have a fundamental design flaw that makes it impossible to build a
> fast compiler for.

See notes.md for the findings I collected so far.
